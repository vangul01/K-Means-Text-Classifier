-------------------------------- BEST CHOICE OF K is K = 8 ----------------------------------
Having more K's up to a certain point (which I found to be K=8) shows the subtleties of other topics present in the articles. When I first read through the articles, I classified them like so:

1 = Group 1
2 = Group 1
3 = Group 1  but not quite… airplane parts heist
4 = Group 1
5 = Group 2
6 = Group 2 but not quite… meat health safety issues, vague on hoof and mouth
7 = Group 3
8 = Group 3
9 = Group 2 predominantly about hoof and mouth disease, has some info on airline hijacking
10 = 1 or 2 —> Group 1 because more text for hoof mouth disease but more airline safety top words

With K=8, the documents that I was certain of being in a topic ended up being most similar to documents that all had the same label, whereas the ones that I could see as not fitting their topic 100% were similar to more of a mix of documents, predominantly the ones I would have labeled them as but also with 1 or 2 documents that were different topics. The documents 9 and 10 that were split on hoof and mouth disease and airline safety were close to evenly split with larger and smaller K values and in general are labeled how I would have labeled them too. 

With small K values, you don't really get to see how well a document fits with the label it was given because you only end up basing the categorization on 1 or 2 documents. They were still labeled the way I would have labeled them, but there are no subtleties present in the labeling, its more general. Overall I think a K value of 8 was interesting because it noticed the subtleties I noticed when going through the documents. 8 is probably a really good number to choose because there are originally 8 documents per topic, so its better for seeing how closely a document actually fits in to a group of 8.
